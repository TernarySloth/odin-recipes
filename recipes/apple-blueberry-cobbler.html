    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe was inspired by camping trips I used to take with my family when I was younger. Originally, this cobbler was 
        made using huckleberries, and baked over a campfire; but since I no longer live in an area where I can get huckleberries
         and don't have a constant campfire going, I substituted frozen wild blueberries and baked it in the oven instead. I also use 
         a homemade apple beer in the batter, but use whatever hard cider or fruity beer you like.
