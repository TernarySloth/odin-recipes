        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 8-inch round cake pans with 
                vegetable oil spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, sift together flour, salt, and baking powder. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, cream butter with the sugar until fluffy. Add egg and beat well. 
                Add flour mixture alternately with the evaporated milk. Fold in vanilla and almond 
                extracts and 1 cup chopped figs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide into two prepared 8-inch round cake pans. Bake in preheated oven until cake 
                springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip and a toothpick inserted into the 
                center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cake layers on wire rack.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make the filling: In a saucepan, combine 2 cups chopped figs, brown sugar, water, 
                and lemon juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until thickened, 
                about 20 minutes. Spread thinly between cooled cake layers and on top.
